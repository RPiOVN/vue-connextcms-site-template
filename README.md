# P2P VPS - Server

## What is P2P VPS?
P2P VPS aspires to create a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace offering Virtal Private Servers (VPS), similar to 
[Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com) or [Vultr](http://vultr.com). This would also be similar
to co-location services like [Raspberry Pi Hosting](https://raspberry-hosting.com/en) or 
[Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/order/rpi).
However, instead of using a data center,
the marketplace would use an array of psudo-anonymous IoT devices (like the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/))
hosted by people participating in the marketplace. Anyone
with an internet connection and a device capable of running [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) can rent
that device in the P2P VPS marketplace.

While [the applications of such a network](https://raspberry-hosting.com/en/applications) are similar, 
the P2P VPS marketplace will never have the speed or reliabilityof the commercial outfits linked above.
Instead, the focus of P2P VPS is to create a decentralized network of anonymous web servers,
capable of delivering websites or web apps, in order to prevent censorship and promote free speech.

Members participating in the marketplace can earn cryptocurrency by renting out their device, while
helping to create a more decentralized internet at the same time.
That's the focus of the P2P VPS network. In this way, the P2P VPS software is censorship-fighting
software similar to, but very different from, [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/).

## About This Repository
This repository is the server-side software needed to host a P2P VPS marketplace on your own server.
The repository was customized from a forked copy of the [vue-connextcms-site-template](https://github.com/skagitpublishing/vue-connextcms-site-template)
repository. The P2P VPS software is composed of three software packages:

1. *The Client* software runs on the IoT device and allows the device to be rented.
2. *The Server* software includes the database models, REST APIs, and website content.
3. *The Marketplace* which a Vue.js client-side application which facilitates transactions and administration of devices.

[The Client software can be found here](https://github.com/RPiOVN/p2pvps-client). 
This repository contains *The Server* and *The Marketplace* software.

### File Layout
* The `site-template-connextcms/` directory contains the ConnextCMS site template files needed to create database models
and REST APIs required for the Clients and Marketplace to coordinate and persist data. For more information, see the
Readme for [ConnextCMS Site Templates](https://github.com/skagitpublishing/site-template-connextcms).

* The rest of this readme describes the build options for developing *The Marketplace*, which is a Vue.js application
bundled through Webpack. The code for this application lives in the `src` directory.
For additional details, see the [vue-connextcms-site-template](https://github.com/skagitpublishing/vue-connextcms-site-template)
repository.

* The [specifications directory](specifications) contains specification documents illustrating how the P2P VPS server works.

* The [docs directory](docs) contains miscellaneousdocumentation. 


## Build Setup
For detailed explanation on how the build commands work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# build as a site template for ConnextCMS
npm run connextcms

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

## Installation
Follow the instructions below to generate a ConnextCMS site template and serve your new site template through ConnextCMS.
It is assumed you are building on a server running Ubuntu Linux.

1. Install [docker-connextcms](https://github.com/skagitpublishing/docker-connextcms). The scripts in this repository
assume that the `docker-connextcms` repository is cloned in your non-root user home directory, e.g. `~`

2. Install Node.js and NPM on your machine. [This tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04)
shows how to install it on a Digital Ocean Droplet. The code in this repository has been tested against Node v6.x LTS.

3. After cloning this repository, run `npm install` to install dependencies and then `npm run connextcms` to build
the ConnextCMS site template. 

4. Generate your site template by running the following script:
`./generateSiteTemplate`

5. Copy the site template into the `~/docker-connextcms/theme` directory by running the following script:
`./uploadToConnextCMS`

6. If the ConnextCMS docker container is running, bring it down by chaning directory into `~/docker-connextcms` and
running the command `docker-compose down`. After that completes, bring it back up with `docker-compose up -d`. ConnextCMS
will boot. The standard site template is available at port 3000. The Vue app is available at path `/appdashboard`. To
bring it up in a webbrowser navigate to `http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3000/appdashboard`. Replace the x's with the IP
address of your server.
